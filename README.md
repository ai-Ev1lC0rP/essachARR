# SHR Technology AI Platform

A modern React-based platform offering specialized AI solutions for businesses, containerized with Docker for consistent development and deployment.

## Docker Setup

### Development Environment
The application runs in a Docker container with hot-reload capabilities:
```bash
# Build and start the container
docker-compose up --build

# Stop the container
docker-compose down

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Container Configuration
- Base image: Node 18 Alpine
- Exposed port: 3000 (mapped to host port 3000)
- Working directory: /app
- Development server: http://localhost:3000

### Volume Mappings
Development volumes for hot-reload:
```yaml
- ./src:/app/src
- ./public:/app/public
- ./package.json:/app/package.json
- ./tsconfig.json:/app/tsconfig.json
- ./tailwind.config.js:/app/tailwind.config.js
- node_modules:/app/node_modules
```

### Environment Variables
```yaml

## Design System

### Colors
The platform uses a consistent color scheme defined in Tailwind:
- Primary: shr-primary (brand primary color)
- Accent: shr-accent1 (complementary accent)
- Text: shr-800 (headings), shr-700/80 (body), shr-700/70 (secondary)
- Background gradients: from-white via-shr-50/30 to-shr-100/20

### Component Patterns
Each solution follows a consistent structure:
- Hero section with gradient text and description
- Statistics display in a 4-column grid
- Feature showcase with icons and descriptions
- Task examples in card format
- Trust indicators and testimonials
- Call-to-action with gradient button

### Shared Components
Common UI elements across solutions:
- Navigation bar with transparent/blur states
- Footer with solution links and company info
- Card components with hover effects
- Gradient buttons with scale animations
- Icon containers with primary background

## Navigation Structure
The platform uses a hierarchical navigation:
1. Main navigation (top bar)
   - Solutions
   - Pricing
   - About
   - Contact
2. Solutions grid (on Solutions page)
   - Each AI solution with icon and description
3. Footer navigation
   - Grouped by Solutions, Support, Company, Legal

## Development

### Local Development with Docker
1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed
3. Run `docker-compose up --build`
4. Access the application at http://localhost:3000
5. Changes to source files will trigger hot-reload

### Styling Guidelines
- Use Tailwind utility classes
- Follow BEM-like naming for custom classes
- Maintain consistent spacing with margin/padding scale
- Use provided color variables for brand consistency
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind breakpoints
- Apply hover/focus states for interactive elements

### Routes
- `/`: Homepage
- `/solutions`: Solutions overview
- `/solutions/lexi`: Copywriting AI
- `/solutions/arlo`: Analytics AI
- `/solutions/nova`: eCommerce AI
- `/solutions/recruiting`: Recruiting AI
- `/solutions/dizzy`: Creative AI
- `/pricing`: Pricing plans
- `/about`: Company information
- `/contact`: Contact form

### Component Creation Guidelines
When creating new solution pages:
1. Follow the established component structure
2. Use the shared color scheme and gradients
3. Maintain consistent spacing and grid layouts
4. Include all standard sections (hero, stats, features, etc.)
5. Add route to App.tsx and navigation links
6. Update Solutions.tsx grid and footer
7. Test changes in Docker development environment
